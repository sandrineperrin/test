# Ansible Role: PHP PEAR packages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-pear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-pear)

Installs PHP PEAR packages on servers with PHP and `php-pear` already installed.

## Requirements

PHP and `php-pear` (or the equivalent) must already be installed on the server, so the `pear` command can be run.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    php_pear_channels:
      - pear.phpunit.de
      - pear.symfony.com

The PEAR channels that should be discovered so pear libraries can be installed. By default, PEAR is not configured to autodiscover channels for libraries you would like installed, so you need to explicitly list all the libraries' channels here.

    php_pear_libraries:
      - phpunit/PHPUnit
      - PHP_CodeSniffer

The libraries/extensions you would like installed via PEAR.

## Dependencies

  - geerlingguy.php

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: webservers
      vars_files:
        - vars/main.yml
      roles:
        - { role: geerlingguy.php-pear }

*Inside `vars/main.yml`*:

    php_pear_channels:
      - pear.phpunit.de
    php_pear_libraries:
      - phpunit/PHPUnit

## TODO

  - Continue refining the `changed`/`failed` conditions for PEAR. Yuck.
